# Future Enhancements

A wish list of things I want to do

- ~~Move all databases into a private network. No need to access most of them from outside~~
- ~~Move grouped services into stacks within Portainer~~
- Complete documentation
- ~~Establish monitoring and alerting~~
- ~~Setup DNS server to serve local IPs from local subnet (ex. media.mallett.family should resolve to 192.168.4.42 from within home network)~~
- Reconfigure WIFI (See [Wifi IP Pool](../Wifi%20IP%20Pool.md) )

## Future Stacks

Below are a list of “Future Stacks'“ or simply just applications I want to bring into a stack. These are grouped services that typically rely on each other or are usually ran together.
